# A/D and Mechanics 
- Also known as Lego Assignment
## Requirements 
Python  3.9  <br />
``
To use Switch & Case feature instead of if else statement Python 3.10 is required. However, We need Python 3.9 to run Lego Brick for Assignment 5.
Switch & Case itself good for Assignment 4 but not for Assignment 5. So, i have added another file swapping switch & case to if else statements to suit Assignemnt 5.
